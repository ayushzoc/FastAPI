# FastAPI

### Why we need Schema
* It's a paint to get all the values from the body
* The client can send whatever data they want
* The data isn't getting validated
* We ultimately want to force the client to send data in a schema that we expect


### CRUD
* Create: Post
* Read: Get
* Update: Put/Patch
* Delete: Delete
